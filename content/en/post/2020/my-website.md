Here we are, looking for online visibility.
How does one set that up quickly when starting from scratch?
Do **you** Remember those HTML courses?
**Yeah me neither.**
But fortunately for us it is now easier than ever!

<!-- {{< toc >}} -->

We will discuss in this post how to create our own website with the
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework from a template and
how to deploy it to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
The prerequisites are,

* GitHub
* markdown
* [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/) (optional)

You may find `GitHub` tutorials [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
and [there](https://opensource.com/article/18/1/step-step-guide-git).
Pages of our website will be written in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
You can learn more about markdown from those tutorials,
[in English](http://markdowntutorial.com/) and [in French](https://openclassrooms.com/courses/redigez-en-markdown).
And if you only need a brief refresh,
[here](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/) is the syntax supported by our website.
Finally, you can find a `LXD` tutorial [here](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/getting-started-cli/).

Now, let us set up the necessary stuff to get started, shall we?

## Picking a website template

To build our website, we will use the framework [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
It is very convenient for our use case because it comes with a ton of
[predefined website themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/)
and it is very simple to use.

For the purpose of this tutorial we will use the very theme of this website,
namely, [Academic](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/).
This theme is rather clean, well organized, fairly simple to use and most importantly
it is [well documented](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/)!
Furthermore, it can be found pre-bundled in a `Hugo` project so that
it is pretty much clone and play.
However, at the time of writing, this theme requires `Hugo *Extended*` version 0.67+.
This distinction is important because,
while it is conveniently [packaged as a snap](https://snapcraft.io/hugo),
the snap only offers the classic version, not the *Extended*.
Therefore we have to fetch its debian package and install it manually.

First, let us clone the ready-to-go `Academic` bundle on our machine:

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart.git my_website
cd my_website
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Prepping the tools

To avoid polluting our system, we will set up a Linux container in which we will
install `Hugo Extended`.
The container is totally optional and you can do the installation directly on your machine.
If you do not wish to use a container, skip directly to [Hugo installation](#installing-hugo)

### Setting up the LXC

Let us start a fresh and pull a new `Ubuntu 18.04` instance,

```bash
lxc launch ubuntu:18.04 hugo
```

We will now mount a disk device to share the website source code between our machine and the container:

```bash
lxc config device add hugo workspace disk source=~/my_website path=/home/ubuntu/my_website
lxc config set hugo raw.idmap "both $(id -u) $(id -g)"
lxc restart hugo
```

The default installation of `LXD` set up a bridged network so that containers
live behind a NAT on the host. Therefore, we have to forward the port on which
our website is served by the `Hugo` framework.
To do so, issue the following command:

```bash
lxc config device add hugo proxy1313 proxy connect=tcp:127.0.0.1:1313 listen=tcp:0.0.0.0:1313
```

The container is all set up. We can log to it with:

```bash
lxc exec hugo -- su --login ubuntu
```

### Installing Hugo

We will download the `Hugo` extended debian directly from it `GitHub` repository.
To do so, enter in the terminal:

```bash
wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.70.0/hugo_extended_0.70.0_Linux-64bit.deb
```

At the time of writing, the latest `Hugo Extended` release is version 0.70.0.

We can now install it with:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i hugo_extended_*.deb
```

## First view of our website

Let the show begin. We are now ready to spawn our website and browse it.
In a terminal, enter:

```bash
cd ~/my_website
hugo server
```

Voila!

The website it up and running! To visualize it,
open your web browser at the address `http://localhost:1313`.
That was easy right?

## Making the website your own

We have a great template up and running, it is now time to make it our own.
The `Academic` theme comes with a ton of options and configurations allowing us
to truly personalize it to our liking and use case.
And since its online documentation is so great,
I will let you discovers by yourself all the possibilities the theme offers.
Head down to the [Academic get started documentation](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/get-started/)
and have fun!

Just a quick advice, as you edit your website, let `Hugo` run.
It is able to update the website live so that you see your changes take effect
immediately in your web browser!

## Deploying the website to GitHub

Once our website is ready to be made public,
all there is to do is to push it to `GitHub`.
Well, almost.

In your `GitHub` account, we will create a repository to host your website.
To do so hit the tiny cross `(+)` in the top-right of `GitHub` and select `new repository`.
For `GitHub` to be able to figure out that this particular repository is your personal website
we need to give it a specific name in the form : **\<your-github-user-name>.github.io**.

We will now prepare to push the website to this repository.

First we will add the `GitHub` repository we just created as our remote,

```bash
git add remote origin https://github.com/<your-github-user-name>/<your-github-user-name>.github.io.git
```

and change our branch name to avoid later mess,

```bash
git branch -m master builder
```

Here comes the final step before pushing to `GitHub`.
We must *build* our website, or rather let `Hugo` do it for us.
Indeed so far we have edited the template that `Hugo` uses to build the website.
We have visualized it in our browser but the template cannot be deployed directly
to `GitHub`, it must be built. To build it locally, nothing easier, simply run:

```bash
hugo
```

You will notice a new folder named `public` in our project.
It contains the generated website. It is this content that we must push to our repository.
Furthermore, it must be pushed specifically to the `master` branch.
That's a limitation of personal website on `GitHub`.

### Automatic deployment

So how could we automatize this build and deploy process?

We will add a small script so that every times
we push some new content on the `builder` branch,
`GitHub` will take care of calling `Hugo` (building) and
moving the `public` folder directly on the `master` branch (deploying).

For that, we will use `GitHub actions` and more specifically the
[`actions-hugo`](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo).
Sorry buddy but I'll skip the details about `actons` here as it is all new
to me as well. That could be the topic for a later post tho.

We will simply create a new file in our project to configure the action:

```bash
cd ~/my_website
touch .github/workflows/deploy-website.yml
```

which we will edit as follows:

```yaml
name: deploy website

# We will run the actions whenever something
# is pushed to the branch 'builder'
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - builder

jobs:

  # Our action is called 'deploy' and runs on Ubuntu 18.04
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04

    # The action executes the following steps
    steps:

      # It fetch our repository and its submodules
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          submodules: true  # Fetch Hugo themes
          fetch-depth: 0    # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod

      # It then set up Hugo Extended
      - name: Setup Hugo
        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
        with:
          hugo-version: '0.68.3'
          extended: true

      # It runs Hugo to generate the website
      - name: Build
        run: hugo --minify

      # It copies the content of the 'public' folder to the branch 'master'
      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./public
          publish_branch: master
```

With our automatic deployment configured, all there remains to do is to push to `GitHub`!

Let us remove the 'public' folder is it exists,

```bash
cd ~/my_website
rm -r public
```

and commit all of our changes,

```bash
git add .
git commit 'made the website my own'
```

Finally, we push the changes upstream,

```bash
git push origin builder
```

Voila!

After a couple minutes your website is now available at the address:

`https://<your-github-user-name>.github.io/`

Congrats on your new online visibility, our job here is done.

## Bonus: Academic publications

If you happen to have some academic publications that you would like to showcase
on your website, we will install a Python tool called `academic`
that will help us to automatically generate pages from `Bibtex`.

First we will install `pip3`:

```bash
apt install python3-pip
```

to then install `academic`:

```bash
pip3 install -U academic
```

Given that we have a `.bib` file that contains all of our publications,
we can generate the pages as follows:

```bash
cd ~/my_website
academic import --bibtex <path_to_your/publications.bib>
```

You can find more information in the
[Academic theme documentation](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/#create-a-publication).
