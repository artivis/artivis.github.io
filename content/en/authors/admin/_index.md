Jérémie Deray is a software engineer at
[Canonical](https://canonical.com/),
the company publishing [Ubuntu&#160;<i class="fab fa-ubuntu"></i>](https://ubuntu.com/).
As part of the robotics team he is working on both ROS and ROS 2 -
development, maintenance, dev tools, security, snaps...
Before that he worked at
[PAL Robotics](https://pal-robotics.com/en/home/) on navigation,
perception and a little bit of control, this for various robots -
mobile-base, mobile-manipulator, semi-humanoid.

Jérémie is also a PhD in the field of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
applied to industrial mobile-bases.
The research has taken place in a collaborative framework between the company
[PAL Robotics](https://pal-robotics.com/en/home/) and
the [Universitat Politècnica De Catalunya (IRI-UPC)](https://www.iri.upc.edu/),
both located in the lovely city of Barcelona, Spain.
The research work has been supervised by [Joan Solà](http://www.joansola.eu/) and
[Juan Andrade Cetto](https://www.iri.upc.edu/staff/cetto).
