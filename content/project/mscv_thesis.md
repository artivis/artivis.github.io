We will find in a near future more and more robots in our environment,
including public places (e.g. malls, museums, hospitals).
This requires a strong robustness in any task to ensure the safety of both people and robots.
If nowadays we can find pretty accurate sensors (e.g. laser range finder),
they however are of little help in crowded places.
Especially since humanoid robots are still a curiosity for the public and
as such are often completely surrounded. This is why it is important to
investigate sensors which provide as much information as possible for the lowest cost possible.
Omnidirectional cameras are well suited for this task. Indeed as shown in this thesis,
two fisheye cameras are enough to get a full 360° view of the robot environment.
This permits in a first place the robot to localize itself and in a second place,
any usual use of camera can be adapted such as navigation, face detection etc.
